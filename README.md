# Space-Invader-Project
Author: Levi Johnson
Description: A 2D shooting game made in Unity that resembles
  Space Invaders in terms of game mechanics. As time progresses,
  the player moves horizontally and shoots at target enemies 
  spawning in waves from the top of the camera view that 
  approach the player progressively faster until the player is 
  either eliminated by allowing enemies to pass them or by 
  successfully destroying a set amount of enemies. This project 
  utilized Unity, Visual Studio, and C# to practice skills in 
  Game Engine mastery and solving complex logic problems.
